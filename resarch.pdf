ABSTRACT

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services-servers, storage, databases 
  networking, software, analytics, Intelligence and most important the cloud
(internet) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economics of scale. The
biggest cloud computing services run on worldwide network of secure datacenters,
which are regularly advanced to the hottest generation of fast and efficient
computing hardware. security issues present a robust barrier for users to adapt into
cloud computing systems. This paper presents a review on the cloud computing
issues within the context  cloud.

INTRODUCTION

The Google defined as cloud computing means storing and accessing data and
program over the internet instead  of your computers hard drive [1]. The IBM and
Investopedia defined as cloud computing is a method for delivering information
technology (IT) services in which  resources are retrieved from the internet
through web based tools and applications as opposed to a direct connection to a
server[2,3]. cloud computing is a set of principles and approaches to deliver
infrastructure, services, platforms and applications[1]. Computing Cloud
computing concept originated from telecommunication companies changing to
VPN. The history  of cloud computing starts way back in the 1960’s .
Could computing removes the need for many of these task’s so IT teams can spend
time on achieving more important business goals. Companies can save big by
employing cloud computing as it eliminates cost for hardware and software . All
data located on a centralized location , data more  organized making it easy to
manage .Cloud computing increased storage capacity is another benefit of the

could , as it can store more data as compare to personal computer. cloud computing
also allows you to customize your business applications. cloud computing does not
need high quality equipment  for the user and it is easy to use . cloud computing
services users can check their email on any computer and even store files using
services such as Dropbox and Google drive[10] .
Security issues present a strong barrier foe users to adopt into cloud computing
systems. Security are the biggest concerns about cloud computing . Major problem 
cloud computing is users dependency on the provider .migration problem is also a
big concern about cloud computing . The most obvious disadvantage is that cloud
computing relies on network connections . The risk of cloud computing taking
services from remote servers.
